"""Rule-catalog resolution keyed by benchmark.

The engine itself is benchmark-agnostic: it loads ONE catalog via ``--catalog``
and dispatches rules purely on ``family``.  This module answers the *only*
benchmark-specific question in the core: **which catalog file does a given
profile/role use?**

Historically there is exactly one catalog per role, ``rules.json``.  To support
a second benchmark (e.g. STIG, NIST-800-53) for the same OS without renaming
anything, a profile may point at a benchmark-specific file
(``rules_<slug>.json``).  CIS and the legacy empty/unknown benchmark keep
``rules.json`` so the 12 byte-identical engine copies and all existing tests
stay untouched.
