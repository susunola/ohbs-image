# Test Matrix

Validated CIS-hardened images across the supported OS × level grid.
All builds ran on Tencent Cloud Guangzhou region with `cis_allow_disruptive: false`;
every image below was re-verified in the console as `NORMAL` on 2026-08-14.

Build instance types: Linux profiles used `S5.MEDIUM2` (2 vCPU / 4 GB);
Windows profiles used `S5.LARGE4` (4 vCPU / 8 GB).

> Scores are the post-reboot re-audit results (all assessed rules, gate ≥ 85).
> kmod rules are applied via persistent modprobe install-overrides — no rule
> exclusions are needed at build time.
> Windows images are member-server builds from the Tencent Cloud Datacenter
> EN/CN public images, built and re-audited on 2026-08-14; WinRM is
> re-locked (Basic/unencrypted off, Administrator password randomized) before snapshot.
> The single remaining Windows fail on every build is "Deny access to this
> computer from the network → include S-1-5-114" (2.2.2x), which is deliberately
> skipped as disruptive: applying it would cut off the very WinRM session the
> build runs on. Enable it post-boot with `cis_allow_disruptive: true`.
